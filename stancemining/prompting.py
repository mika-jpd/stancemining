    Instructions:
    1. Review the provided stance targets and keyphrases that characterize the stance target cluster
    2. Identify the common specific stance issues these targets relate to
    3. Generate 1-3 appropriately specific noun phrases that:
    - Are specific enough to meaningfully represent the stance being taken
    - Are general enough to apply to the whole cluster
    - Include relevant context like policy domains, affected groups, or implementation approaches
    - Each noun phrase should be max 5 words
    - If inputs are low quality (just emojis, Twitter handles, random phrases), return []

    Input:
    Representative stance targets: [list of stance targets]
    Top keyphrases: [list of high tf-idf terms]

    Output format:
    Generalized target: ["appropriately specific noun phrase 1", "appropriately specific noun phrase 2", "appropriately specific noun phrase 3"]
